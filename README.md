`Piksy` is an online pictionary platform. Here people would be joining rooms (only 1 room for now), and the game would begin by selecting a participant at random, who will be given an option to select a word from set of 3 words. After choosing this, he may start drawing, given 80 secs per drawing. <br><br>
Other participants would be looking at the board on their screen in realtime. They have to guess the word being drawn. Points will be awarded on first right answer basis. <br><br>
This will go on for every participant in the room. After everyone's turn, round 1 will be over. There would be 3 rounds per match.<br><br>
Built using ExpressJS, Socket.io. Mongoose and Redis for Db.

## [Overview](#overview)
- __Real time drawing board:__ Using web-sockets synced across all the clients in real-time, plotting the same drawing done on the drawer's screen.
- __Chat Box:__ This would be the place where participants would be typing their guesses. To be synced real time. Filter curse words from bag of words. No limit on guesses by the participants.
- __Point system:__ Highest point to the first person to guess, plus the bonus points according to remaining time. Base points to be given compulsarily to everyone. Relative scores for the drawer.
- __User selection:__ Choose the participant randomly at start and then proceed linearly, or some other way; so that everyone gets to be a drawer once in each round.
- __Kick and ban:__ Ability to kick anyone from the room (to avoid misbehavior) by admin. Or option for participants to kick another user, if 5 people vote on kicking a particular participant.
- __Word recommender:__ Choose 3 words at random from bag of words and show it to the drawer. Keep base points for each word, but dont reveal it to the participants.
- __Letter-by-letter Reveal:__ Guessing the whole word might be hard for participants and would make the game boring. So, reveal the letters at random positions, one by one (obviously keeping a max limit for the reveal).
- __Word relevance:__ When the participant guesses the word, add an subtle alert in the chat-box that the guessed word was close to the answer. Could use fuzzy-match algo for this. Suggest if you got some better one

## [Game Flow](#gameflow)
Sr. No |  Description
-------|-----------------------------------------------------
1      |  `x` minutes wait time for people to join the room.
2      |  Commence the game, by selecting a participant at random
3      |  Give the drawer option to choose from 3 words.
4      |  After selection, give him blank drawboard. With colors and other tools to beautify his drawing
5      |  Present to the user the size of words, like _ _ _ _
6      |  As the user draws, update all clients screens.
7      |  Mark the user as done, if he guesses the object.
8      |  Stop the drawing on time limit. Show em the scores
9      |  4 seconds interval, then next participant selected to draw.
10     |  At the end of round1, show em scores. Start round2 after 20 seconds.
11     |  After end of all three rounds(end of match), display the scores and restart the game resetting the socres for that match (0 all)
12     |  Store the scores per match for all the participants in their profile.
13     |  Ability to exit the game in between, won't harm their scores. Thier current score should be added to their account on quitting.


## [Socket Actions](#functions)
Function                |   Description
------------------------|------------------------------------------
playerRoomJoin   (S)       |Adds users to drawStack and users object. Check if room has more than 2 peeps. Also, If yes and matchStarted == False, then emit startNewMatch.
startNewMatch  (S) |        Set the currentRound to 0, matchStarted to True, set all users points to zero. , emit startNewRound
startNewRound (S)          |  Shuffle drawStack, Increment the current round +1. Run update turn.
updateTurn    (F)          |  Pop off the latest from drawStack. Update currentDrawer. If nothing to pop off, then call endRound
wordSelection (S)           |  send words to currentDrawer
wordSelected(C)         | Update currentWord, start 80 second (setTimeout) for game on server, emit gameStart
gameStart(S)            | Broadcast to all users, also send timestamp of when the game started. On client side, start timers from (80 - (Date.now()-tStamp)) 
userGuessed(S)          | Inform all users that persom has guessed the word
gameEnd(S)              | Runs on the end of the 80 second timer on server. Send usersGuessed array (with points) to all users
clear(C)                | Check if from currentDrawer, emit broadcastClear
broadcastClear(S)       | Push to canvas state, broadcast to all users
draw(C)                 | Check if from currentDrawer, emit broadcastDraw
broadcastDraw(S)        | Push to canvas state, broadcast to all users
newColor(C)             | Sent by person drawing, emit broadcastNewColor
newThickness(C)         | Sent by person drawing, emit broadcastNewThickness
broadcastNewColor(S)     |  Push to canvas state, broadcast to all users
broadcastNewThickness(S) |  Push to canvas state, broadcast to all users
chatMessage(C)             | Check if guess is right. If yes, append username and constant points (as object) to usersGuessed, and then broadcast userGuessed. If its not correct, them emitBroadcastChatMessage. If all the users have guessed, run gameEnd
broadcastChatMessage(S)   | Send message to all users
playerLeft              | Remove from users, if the person who left is == currentDrawer, run gameEnd
endRound                | call StartNewRound. If currentRound == maxRounds then run endMatch
endMatch                | call startNewMatch

Example:
```
const playerJoinRoom = (data) => {
	const { gameID } = data;
	data.mySocketID = this.id;
	this.join(gameID.toString());
	this.in(gameID).emit("playerJoinedRoom", data);
};
```
